# TODO List for Key-Value Database Project

1. Design the database schema
    - Define the structure of keys and values
    - Determine data types and constraints

2. Implement basic CRUD operations
    - Create: Add new key-value pairs
    - Read: Retrieve values by key
    - Update: Modify existing key-value pairs
    - Delete: Remove key-value pairs

3. Develop indexing mechanism
    - Implement indexing for faster lookups
    - Optimize index structure for performance

4. Implement persistence layer
    - Design file storage format
    - Implement read/write operations to disk

5. Add transaction support
    - Implement basic transaction handling
    - Ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties)

6. Develop query language
    - Design a simple query language for interacting with the database
    - Implement query parsing and execution

7. Implement security features
    - Add authentication and authorization mechanisms
    - Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit

8. Optimize performance
    - Profile and identify bottlenecks
    - Implement caching strategies

9. Write unit and integration tests
    - Ensure all components are thoroughly tested
    - Achieve high code coverage

10. Create documentation
     - Write user guides and API documentation
     - Provide examples and usage scenarios

11. Prepare for deployment
     - Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines
     - Ensure the database is ready for production use
